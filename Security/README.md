# Security Testing and Improvements

This project has undergone security testing and improvements using Slither and Echidna tools to enhance security and identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Tools

- **Slither**: A static analysis tool for Solidity smart contracts. It helps improve code quality and detect security vulnerabilities.
- **Echidna**: A property-based testing tool for smart contracts. It performs randomized tests to uncover potential bugs and security issues.
